The group for this project will be Benjamin Scott, Julian Nolasco, Dontae Esdaile, Matt Harada, and Nicolas Jones. Ben will work on the UI, 
Julian, Dontae, and Nicolas will work on the scripts for the character movement and game functions, and Matt will work on the audio for the game.
The style of our game will be an animated or cartoon-like game. The concept will be similar to the game Flappy Bird. The perspective of the project will
be a 2D game. The controls will be to repeatedly press spacebar to make the bird fly and dodge tubes. A user can expect a game experience similar to the
game Flappy Bird where the game side-scrolls and tubes keep appearing on the screen until the player hits a tube and the game ends with an option to 
restart.
